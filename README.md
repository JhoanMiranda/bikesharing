# bikesharing

## NYC Citybike

#### This analysis was made to convince the investors through visualizations, that implementing bike-sharing program in Des Moines can be profitable.
#### After gathering the information, we used Tableau to combine, filter and transform the data in graphs, plots and maps with that information.

#### Using Tableau, we could show the investors that most of our clients are young male subscribers that use the bikes during peak hours follow by women.

#### Due to the inactivity of most of our bikes during the first 4 hours of the day we can do the repairs or the maintenance of our bikes in those hours.

#### With the bikes ID and the starting points, we could trace the one that the customer used the most, that way we can schedule the repairs, also we can be prepared for the times and the locations where bikes are needed the most.
#### The bike-sharing program could be a good alternative for Des Moines because bikes can be used by people of any backgrounds, at any time and place.
